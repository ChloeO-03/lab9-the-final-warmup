# ADR 001: Using Lit for Web Components

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need a framework for building the todo app. Options: Vanilla JS, Lit, React, Vue.

## Decision
Use Lit.

## Why

**Lit Pros:**
- Small (5KB), fast
- Based on web standards
- Easy to learn
- No framework lock-in
- Works everywhere

**Why not others:**
- **Vanilla**: Too much boilerplate
- **React**: Too big (40KB), overkill
- **Vue**: Bigger, framework-specific

## Result
